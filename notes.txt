Refactor Ansible playbook for better error handling and system manipulation

Details:

    Introduced a variable playbook_name with the value "setup_libvirt_host.yml".

    Added failed_when conditions in tasks "Retrieve image for workload", "Install tools for workload" and "Install required packages, if any, for workload" for better error handling.

    Refactored the "Handle reboot, if needed" task block with additional tasks: checking for an existing systemd service unit file, creating a systemd service unit file using a template if not present, enabling and starting the service, and finally rebooting the system.


    Introduced a new task "Check if the service exists" and a conditional block of tasks for stopping the systemd service, reloading the systemd daemon, and removing the service file if it exists.

These changes enhance error handling, improve system configuration management, and ensure better cleaning up of resources after use.
