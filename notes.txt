"Enhanced error handling and added auto-reboot functionality in setup_libvirt_host.yml"

Changes:

1. Added a comment at the top of the file to explain how to enable auto reboot while running as root and to ensure ansible container is installed as root.

2. Added two new variables: 'ansible_playbook_basename' and 'playbook_path' under 'vars'.

3. Added 'failed_when' conditions to the tasks 'Retrieve image for workload {{ workload.name }}', 'Install tools for workload {{ workload.name }}', and 'Install required packages, if any, for workload {{ workload.name }}' to enhance error handling.

4. Split the 'Handle reboot, if needed' task into two separate tasks: 'Handle manual reboot, if needed' and 'Handle auto reboot, if needed'. The latter includes additional tasks to check if the service unit file exists, create a systemd service unit file if it doesn't exist, enable and start the systemd service, and reboot the system after all tasks.

5. Added a comment to the task 'Enable service to start on reboot for workload {{ workload.name }}' to clarify its purpose.
